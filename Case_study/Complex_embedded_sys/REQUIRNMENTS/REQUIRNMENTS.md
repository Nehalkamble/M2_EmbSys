* Identifying features
   * would be able to pinpoint the direction of sun
   * easy to install
   * one time investment
   * incrases the power production by 30%
* State of art/ Research
    * we need to focus on sustainable energy sources and also get the best possible output from it.


* Requirnments for this project are
    * hardwares
        * solar pannel
        * arduino 
        * light dependent sensors
        * resistors
        * servo motors, etc
    * data of soalr power generation
        * with tracking
        * without tracking
        

* SWOT ANALYSIS
