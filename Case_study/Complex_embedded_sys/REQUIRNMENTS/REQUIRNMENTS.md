## INTRODUCTION
 * The goal of this thesis was to study of a solar tracking system, which is able to enhance the performance of the photovoltaic modules in a solar energy system. The operating principle of the device is to keep the photovoltaic modules constantly aligned with the sunbeams, which maximizes the exposure of solar panel to the Sunâ€™s radiation. As a result, more output power can be produced by the solar panel.
The work of the project included hardware design and implementation, together with software programming for the microcontroller unit of the solar tracker. The system utilized an Arduino NANO microcontroller to control motion of two servo motors, which rotate solar panel in two axes. The amount of rotation was determined by the microcontroller, based on inputs retrieved from four photo sensors located next to solar panel.
At the end of the project, a functional solar tracking system was designed and implemented. It was able to keep the solar panel aligned with the sun, or any light source repetitively. Design of the solar tracker from this project is also a reference and a starting point for the development of more advanced systems in the.
## REQUIRNMENTS
    * The main aim of our project is to track the maximum solar energy without radiation loss for the efficient use of solar energy, and logging data (voltage, current).
    * The problem with the existing system is stationery solar panels cannot track maximum radiations hence most of energy is wasted.
    * What we expect through logging the data is that before a user buys any solar panel and is expecting it to work at the given rated voltage or current, he or she can check the validity of that rating on the apparatus used for solar tracking by our project.
    * In order to overcome this, our project aims at implementing rotatory solar panel using microcontrollers which will rotate by sensing the intensity of the radiation and togs the data (voltage and current) for testing the capacity of the solar panel.
