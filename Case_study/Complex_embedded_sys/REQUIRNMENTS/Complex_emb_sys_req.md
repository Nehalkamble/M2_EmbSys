* REQUIRNMENTS
    * The main aim of our project is to track the maximum solar energy without radiation loss for the efficient use of solar energy, and logging data (voltage, current).
    * The problem with the existing system is stationery solar panels cannot track maximum radiations hence most of energy is wasted.
    * What we expect through logging the data is that before a user buys any solar panel and is expecting it to work at the given rated voltage or current, he or she can check the validity of that rating on the apparatus used for solar tracking by our project.
    * In order to overcome this, our project aims at implementing rotatory solar panel using microcontrollers which will rotate by sensing the intensity of the radiation and togs the data (voltage and current) for testing the capacity of the solar panel.
